 #Instagram Usage & Lifestyle Data Analysis
#Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing Instagram user behavior and lifestyle patterns using a large-scale dataset.
The analysis aims to understand how demographics, lifestyle habits, mental well-being, and content preferences influence Instagram usage and user engagement.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insight generation using Python.

 #Objective

The main objectives of this project are to:

Analyze Instagram usage patterns across different demographic groups

Study the relationship between lifestyle factors and social media engagement

Identify key drivers of user engagement on Instagram

Present insights through clear visualizations and structured analysis

# Dataset Overview

Dataset Name: Instagram Usage Lifestyle Dataset

Format: CSV

Records: ~1.5 million users

Features: 50+ variables including:

Demographics (age, gender, country, urban/rural)

Lifestyle (sleep, exercise, stress, hobbies)

Instagram usage (sessions, reels, likes, DMs, time spent)

Engagement metrics (user engagement score)

# Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Version Control: Git & GitHub

# Methodology
1. Data Collection & Exploration

Loaded the CSV dataset using Pandas

Examined data structure, data types, and dimensions

Generated summary statistics to understand distributions

Checked for missing values and inconsistencies

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handled missing values using mean/median and mode imputation

Detected and treated outliers using IQR and box plots

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot and label encoding

Scaled numerical features where required

Created derived features to enrich analysis

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of key numerical variables

Studied relationships between engagement and usage metrics

Visualized correlations using heatmaps

Compared usage patterns across demographic and lifestyle groups

4. Visualization & Insights

Created clear, assessment-friendly plots

Identified trends, patterns, and significant relationships

Summarized insights relevant to user behavior and engagement

# Key Insights

Younger users (18–35) show higher engagement levels

Video, reels, and stories are the most preferred content types

Higher stress levels are associated with increased screen time

Users with balanced lifestyle habits show consistent engagement

Premium feature users demonstrate higher interaction and session length

Urban users have more frequent sessions, while rural users have longer sessions
